  It was a normal day for Jill. Just checking her email when she sees an email from her college buddy Marco. She heard stories about him, and how he turned to a life of crime, but she didn't believe the stories. He sent her a link to a skype page. She clicked on the link. A few days later all her banking information was stolen. She called Marco and asked what happened, but it wasn't Marco. Somebody hacked him and Jill! Jill was hacked for money. It wasn't recognized as nobody found out who did it.
